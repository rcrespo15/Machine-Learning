Machine Learning

This repository contains the code used for the class CS289 from UC Berkeley. Most of the code was done in the context of class work and lacks proper syntax, comments, good practices etc. The code is a working progress as I am working on cleaning it and making it reproducible. Look for the tag "finish" in the code to make sure it is a finished code and not a working progress. 

Feel free to contact me at ramon_crespo@berkeley.edu if any questions or suggestions.
